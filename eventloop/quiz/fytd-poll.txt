- In eventloop/poll.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.

Output: 
foo
done
Read Error

The script execution starts synchronously and exeucuted on main thread.
Since the first function is an asynchronous function it gets added in event loop and in the poll phase as it has to perform IO operation.
We continue the remaining operations in the script synchronously which prints "foo" and "done" and after completing it, async function output is printed which prints "Read Error".
