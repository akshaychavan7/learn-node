- Explain the order of execution in terms of the event loop for eventloop/poll_timer.js.
The order of execution will be as follows:
someAsyncOperation
104ms have passed since I was scheduled

Fisrly, setTimeout is called which puts its operations into an event loop in timer phase. Once this timer finishes, then it will get added to pending callbacks phase.
Next, someAsyncOperation() function is called with a callback function. This function has to perform an IO operation, thus it gets added to poll phase with a higher priority and gets executed first. 
After the someAsyncOperation() function completes, then the remaining tasks in pending callbacks are completed.

- Will the order of execution change if the delay in the while loop is changed from 10s to 150s? Why or why not?
No. This is because we are reading a fairly small file which gets read pretty quickly causing the IO operation to be completed first.
- Will the order of execution change if timeout is changed to 0? Why or why not?
Yes. If the timeout for setTimeout function is very small then the order of execution will change.
